* OmegleTerminal

A simple Omegle terminal client

** NO LONGER FUNCTIONAL (10/04/2020)

Recently Omegle has changed their architecture to support google recaptcha for
the authentication of users. I've not had luck from my locale getting this
working as Omegle is always asking for a recaptcha.

Please check the [[./connection.org][Connection info]] for more information.
